Partner Experience: Comprehensive Website Experience Vision
Overview
This document outlines our vision for the partner website experience, focusing on the discovery and acquisition stage of the partner journey. The website serves as the critical first touchpoint for potential partners and must effectively communicate our value proposition, differentiate Deriv from competitors, and initiate a seamless transition to registration.
Current State Assessment
Pain Points
Generic Value Proposition: Current website content speaks generically to all partners without addressing specific partner types or needs.
Unclear Differentiation: The unique advantages of Deriv's partner program compared to competitors are not clearly articulated.
Complex Navigation: Potential partners must navigate through multiple pages to find relevant information.
Inconsistent Messaging: Value proposition and benefits vary across different pages and materials.
Limited Self-Discovery: Partners who don't fit traditional categories have difficulty finding their path.
Passive Approach: Current acquisition relies heavily on inbound interest rather than proactive targeting.
Disjointed Handoff: The transition from website to registration lacks continuity and context preservation.
Strategic Principles
Core Offerings and Navigation Structure The website should maintain clear separation between different business offerings:


Main Navigation Structure:
Deriv Partners: The core partner program for referrals and commissions
Deriv API: For developers building trading applications
This separation ensures each offering receives appropriate focus and speaks to its target audience effectively. Note that Deriv Prime should NOT be featured on the main partners homepage.


Interest-Based Navigation (Within Deriv Partners) The Deriv Partners section should guide potential partners based on their primary goals:
Individual Referrers: For those seeking passive income with minimal effort
Content Creators & Webmasters: For those with online audiences and websites
Trading Professionals (IBs): For introducing brokers and trading experts
Network Builders: For those building and managing affiliate networks
Just Exploring: For undecided prospects who want to browse all options


Progressive Disclosure Information should be presented in layers of increasing detail:
Level 1: High-level benefits and value proposition
Level 2: Program structures and tier benefits
Level 3: Basic commission examples and qualification criteria
Level 4 (Partners Hub only): Detailed calculations and technical specifications


Benefits Before Mechanics Lead with what partners gain, not how the system works:
Focus on outcomes partners can achieve
Showcase success stories and realistic earnings
Position commission structures as a means to an end
Emphasize support, tools, and growth opportunities


Clear Differentiation Highlight what makes Deriv's partner program unique:
Tier-based progression system with multipliers
Premium support programs (121 Partner Program)
Master Partner program available to all partners
Educational resources and growth support
Future State Vision
Vision Statement
Prospective partners easily discover our program through targeted channels and immediately understand the unique value proposition that differentiates Deriv from competitors, with clear pathways based on their specific goals and business models.
Future State Narrative
In our vision, potential partners encounter Deriv through targeted digital and in-person channels tailored to their specific needs and markets. Landing pages immediately communicate our unique value proposition with clear, compelling benefits that address the primary motivations of different partner segments.
The website experience uses an interest-based approach combined with self-discovery options, allowing partners to follow their preferred path while showcasing our tier-based benefits structure, Partner 121 program, and Master Partner opportunities for those who qualify.
High-potential partners receive personalized outreach from Country Managers who understand their specific market dynamics, with references to upcoming regional seminars and events. The path from interest to application is seamless, with minimal clicks and clear expectations at each step.
